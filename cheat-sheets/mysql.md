## Creating a new user

```mysql
CREATE USER 'newuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

## Grant privileges

Replace `ALL PRIVILEGES` to one of these if needed

`ALL PRIVILEGES` - allow a MySQL user full access to a designated database
`CREATE` - allows them to create new tables or databases
`DROP` - allows them to them to delete tables or databases
`DELETE` - allows them to delete rows from tables
`INSERT` - allows them to insert rows into tables
`SELECT` - allows them to use the SELECT command to read through databases
`UPDATE` - allow them to update table rows
`GRANT OPTION` - allows them to grant or remove other usersâ€™ privileges

```mysql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'newuser'@'localhost';
```

## Refreshing privileges

```mysql
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
