Welcome to my humble wiki where I will be documentating things that I have learnt throughout my career as a web developer.

I am Edward, a mechatronics engineer who was burnt out from university and decided to dive into web development instead.

My primary purpose is to create tech notes as a reference for my future self. Please note, if you are reading this, all the wiki here may not always follow best practices. 

Nanas means pineapple in Malay. The site is called nanas because nanas.app was a cheap domain I bought from GoDaddy. Other than that it is also catchy and my head looks like a pineapple after a haircut. As a chinese, pineapple also means good luck!
