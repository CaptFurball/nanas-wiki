Welcome to my humble wiki where I will be documentating things that I have learnt throughout my career as a web developer.

I am Edward, a mechatronics engineer who was burnt out from university and decided to dive into web development instead. 

With this background, please note that all the wiki here or may not be the best way of doing things. This is because my primary purpose is to create tech notes as a reference for my future self. However, all suggestions are welcomed and I would happily learn more from the tech community.

Nanas means pineapple in Malay. The site is called nanas because nanas.app was a cheap domain I bought from GoDaddy. Other than that it is also catchy and my head looks like a pineapple after a haircut. As a chinese, pinepple also means good luck!
