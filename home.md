Welcome to my humble wiki where I will be documentating things that I have learnt throughout my career as a web developer.

I am Edward, a mechatronics engineer who was burnt out from university and decided to dive into web development instead.

My primary purpose is to create tech notes as a reference for my future self. Please note, if you are reading this, all the wiki here may not always follow industrial best practices due to my inexperience but I will try my best to research before posting anything. Of course, I still do appreciate comments from the people who reads this.

Nanas means pineapple in Malay. The site is called nanas because nanas.app was a cheap domain I bought from GoDaddy. Other than that it is also catchy and my head looks like a pineapple after a haircut. As a chinese, pineapple also means good luck!
