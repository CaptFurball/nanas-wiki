The first entry of blog. Should have done this sooner.

Store-It is meant to be a simple product which allows independent sellers to quickly setup a CMS for product and order management.

This will also be the testimony of my experience as a PHP developer.

The intention is to have an entirely PHP based multipage application for the CMS portion of the project.

This will then be paired with a single page storefront powered by VueJs and Vuetify.

Current state of things: Product and image management portion has been developed. The next targeted item would be to create a way to arrange the order of products as well as the qoutation request. 

Menu arrangement. 
- Menu page management
- Arrangement of products
- Select products to be place into menu
- Mix between priorities of products
- Enable date controlled campaigns

Qoutation request.
- API for requesting qoutation
- To be stored in database
- Admin is able to reply to the request via CMS.
