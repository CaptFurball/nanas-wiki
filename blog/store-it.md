Completed menu module but without all the features mentioned in previous post. Reason being I needed this to be a minimal viable product before I should add the fancy stuff. I should start a list of the fancy stuff I should add.

Postponed qoutation request module until when it is finally needed. I realized, some parts of the project need to be completed before doing qoutation request module.

A little change in direction, store-it will only be used as a store for food/consumables.

Next module to build:

UI for menu display.
- show products in card form
- show products splitted by pages as set in menu
- allow carousell inside the card to swap between images

Jar of fancy items to add after minimal viable product (MVP) is achieved:
- Food product allergen, ingredients
- Limited availability products
- Map mark when requesting for quotation.

The first entry of blog. Should have done this sooner.

Store-It is meant to be a simple product which allows independent sellers to quickly setup a CMS for product and order management.

This will also be the testimony of my experience as a PHP developer.

The intention is to have an entirely PHP based multipage application for the CMS portion of the project.

This will then be paired with a single page storefront powered by VueJs and Vuetify.

Current state of things: Product and image management portion has been developed. The next targeted item would be to create a way to arrange the order of products as well as the qoutation request. 

Menu arrangement. 
- Menu page management
- Arrangement of products
- Select products to be place into menu
- Mix between priorities of products
- Enable date controlled campaigns

Quotation request.
- API for requesting qoutation
- To be stored in database
- Admin is able to reply to the request via CMS.
